# SinkTheShipGame

This project consists on a terminal-based server and various clients that access to the server, via TCP, in order to play "Sink the Ship".

Our main objective was to understand deeply the TCP components and how to use them smoothly.

Also, we have to manage a series of states that each client can have, and be able to register and respond to up to 30 clients simultaneously.

### Instructions to compile the project
Open a terminal in the main directory of the project and write:<br>

```
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make
```
